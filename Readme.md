*** The Accretor ***

Steady-state, axisymmetric, accretion discs.  

This is a serial C code which should compile with vanilla gcc.  Output is in 
ASCII, and some sample Python plotting scripts are provided.

Currently its in a bit of a hacked state.  Parameters are provided at run-time
by a user-specified file (default: in.par).  Some parameters are built-in and 
will be shuffled into the parameter file as necessary.
